INSERT INTO `plants` VALUES (2,'Basil grows best in soil that is loamy, moist, but well-drained. It does well in containers and raised beds.','Full or partial sun.','Plant 10-12 inches apart, further for larger basil varieties.','For Basil Seedlings keep the soil moist. When you are watering the seeds, before the seedlings come up, be careful not to wash the seeds away.','Keep soil moist. Water plants freely during dry periods. Mulch can help the soil hold moisture. Plants in containers need to be watered more often.','Fertilize with a well-balanced fertilizer every 2-6 weeks','Prune back basil plants at the joint between two leaves early and frequently to encourage more growth and branching. The leaves that are cut off during pruning can be used as harvest. Be careful while pruning to not cut off the new branch growth that comes out just above where the leaves branch off. Flowers can be cut off in the same way.','Basil can be harvested early and often. You can start once the basil plant is 6 inches tall and keep harvesting every week or so.','To harvest pinch off the stem just above where two leaves grow out of the stem, careful to avoid harming the little branches that grow out above these leaves. The leaves are best used fresh or in pesto, but can also be dried.'),(3,'Plant in well drained soil. Borage will tolerate soil that is low in nutrients, but prefers soil rich in organic matter. Avoid nitrogen rich soil as this can inhibit flowering. Borage is often grown to add nitrogen to soil because it can absorb nitrogen from the air and store it in its roots. Borage is a good plant to add to your compost after you\'re done growing it.','Plant in full sun to part shade.','Thin plants to 18-24 inches apart. Borage can grow very large.','Water borage seedlings regularly until they get established, although in moister climates you may get away with watering it less often. I didn\'t water my borage that seeded itself at all until later in the season this year.','Bigger borage plants will tolerate drying out between waterings. Water it deeply in hot conditions.','Borage doesn\'t need to be fertilized. If you do decide to fertilize it avoid fertilizers that are high in nitrogen. Fish emulsion or compost tea can be used.','Plants can be pinched back to encourage bushiness. It can be cut back by half in midsummer to encourage new growth. You can use the leaves as mulch for other plants.','Small borage leaves can be harvested before they grow too prickly. They can be eaten in salads or sauteed. Bigger leaves aren\'t good to eat because they become very prickly. Flowers can be eaten once they open. They can be added as garnishes to salads or other dishes. I like to snack on the flowers as I garden.','Leaves and flower clusters can be cut off with a knife or kitchen scissors. Flowers can also be picked individually by pinching down on the center of the flower and pulling...just watch out for pollinators!'),(4,'Well drained soil, between sandy and loamy, that has a good amount of nutrients.','Full sun.','Space plants 46-60 cm (18-24 in) apart.','Water the plants deeply after transplanting','Water plants deeply 1-2 inches per week. Allow the soil to almost dry out between watering, but don\'t let the plants wilt.','Low nitrogen and high phosphorous fertilizer is good for bell peppers. Fertilizing with a tablespoon of Epsom salts after the fruit sets in, can be helpful.','Pruning pepper plants early in the season is said to improve the quality of the fruit, but reduce the yield. It is not mandatory. Cut down on small branches and suckers, but keep the main structure whole. Late in the season, shortly before the last frost you can prune away any blossoms and small peppers in order to speed up the ripening of those peppers that have a chance to make it before the frost.','Harvest when plants reach their expected size and color. Leave peppers on a little longer for sweeter fruit.','Cut ripe peppers off with a sharp knife.'),(5,'Loose sandy soil. Try to remove any rocks and debris from the planting area, because these can lead to misshape carrots. Avoid having soil that is very rich in nitrogen.','Full sunlight to partial shade.','Plant seeds 2-3 inches apart in rows that are 1 foot apart.','Keep the soil moist with shallow waterings while waiting for the plant to germinate. Water seedlings about 1 inch per week.','Water bigger plants about 2 inches per week.','Fertilize with low nitrogen fertilizer 5-6 weeks after planting. Fertilizer that is high in potassium and phosphate is best.','Does not need to be pruned. Weed around the plant carefully to avoid disturbing the roots.','Harvest when carrots are at a desired size, about 2-4 months after planting. You can check the size by carefully brushing away the soil at the base of the plant to expose the top of the carrot. Smaller carrots generally taste better.','Loosen the soil around the plant and pull the plants out by the base'),(17,'Fertile, well draining soil. Slightly acidic.','Full sun','Plant 1 foot apart for vines that are going on a trellis. If they won\'t go on a trellis, space them in rows 3-5 feet apart.','Water the young plants frequently and consistently','Water older plants at least 1 inch per week and stay consistent. Inconsistent watering leads to bitter cucumbers.','Fertilize with compost, or use after the plants start to bloom 5-10-10 fertilizer if you have poor soil quality. Don\'t over fertilize.','Prune off any damaged or diseased parts of the plant consistently. Try to trim away the offshoots and suckers and not the main vine.','Harvest cucumbers when they are at an eating size. Don\'t wait for them to grow too big.','Cut off the cucumber at the stem using a knife or clippers.'),(33,'Soil should be well draining. nasturtium does well in poor soils, because too much nitrogen in the soil leads to more leaves than flowers.','Full sun is best for nasturtium, but they can grow in partial shade, but will have less flowers.','Plant nasturtium 10-12 inches apart. Bush types will become bushy in the garden. Trailing types should be supported so that they can grow up some kind of support. These are also great for hanging baskets and window boxes.','Water regularly and don\'t allow plants to dry out. Small plants don\'t have extensive roots yet.','Keep soil moist, but don\'t over-water. Nasturtiums can be drought tolerant, but it will affect the flavor of the plant. During warm summers you\'ll want to water more often.','Don\'t fertilize unless your soil is very bad. Too much nitrogen will cause less flowers and more leaves.','Cut off faded flowers to encourage more blooming. You can cut back some of the leaves to help new growth from time to time as well.','Leaves and flowers can be harvested at any time, as long as you leave some leaves on so that the plant can keep growing. If you want to harvest the seedpods for eating, harvest them before they get hard.','Cut off leaves, seedpods and flowers with scissors. Pulling off leaves by hand can damage the plant. Leaves, seedpods and flowers are great eaten raw, especially in salads. Seedpods can be pickled.'),(42,'Nutrient rich soil that drains well.','Full sun in cooler regions and part sun in warmer areas.','Seed in rows 12-18 inches apart and thin small seedlings to 6-12 inches apart.','Lettuce likes frequent shallow watering but don\'t over-water.','Lettuce likes frequent shallow watering but don\'t over-water.','Red leaf lettuce can be fertilized using fish emulsion or other fertilizers.','Lettuce doesn\'t need to be pruned, but leaves can be harvested as needed as long as some leaves are still left on the plant.','Plants can be harvested as microgreens or baby plants as soon as they are big enough. Single leaves and whole plants can be harvested once they reach the desired size.','Single leaves can be harvested by cutting off the leaf at the base of the plant as needed as long as some leaves are still left on the plant. Whole plants can be harvested by cutting off the plant at the base. Lettuce tastes best harvested in the mornings.'),(43,'Slightly acidic to neutral, well-draining soil.','Full sun.','','Water evenly.','Water evenly, but don\'t over water. Plants in containers might need to be watered more often.','You mist likely don\'t need to fertilize your rosemary. You can use compost to fertilize it in the spring and summer if it isn\'t growing well.','Prune plants regularly with scissors or a sharp knife. Pruning can be synonymous with harvesting. Don\'t prune more than a third of the plant at a time. Try not to prune when there is a risk of frost approaching. Spring and summer are best for pruning.','You can start harvesting rosemary once it is big enough for you to be able to cut back a third of the plant and still have a good amount of plant left. If you are going to try to overwinter the plant outside, try not to harvest too close before the last frost date of the season.','Cut portions of the stem off with a sharp knife or scissors.'),(49,'Slightly acidic to neutral soil amended with compost.','Full to partial sun.','Sow 2 - 6 inches apart in rows 18 inches apart and thin to 4 - 12 inches apart depending on their size.','Water evenly and consistently.','Water evenly and consistently.','Fertilize with 5-10-10 fertilizer prior to planting. You can add fertilizer later on if the plants are staying small, but don\'t have to.','Once leaves reach around 6 - 8 inches tall, you can start harvesting small amounts frequently to encourage new growth.','Once leaves reach a usable size you can start harvesting the outer leaves, a few leaves per plant at a time.','Cut a few leaves per plant using scissors or a sharp knife.'),(51,'Plant in rich organic soil. It could be helpful to fertilize the soil beforehand.','Plant tomatoes in full sun.','Plant tomatoes 30 - 48\" apart in rows that are 3 - 4\' apart.','Keep the soil moist for seedlings. As they grow bigger, you can water a bit less often.','Tomatoes need lots of water, but it can be helpful to water deeply less often during the growing phase to encourage the plants to develop deep roots, which makes them more drought resistant. When the fruits start growing, you want to water more regularly, so that the tomatoes don\'t split open.','Fertilize with a well balanced fertilizer, but if there are few fruits, but lots of green growth, you want to switch to a low nitrogen fertilizer.','If you are staking the tomatoes, you will want to prune off any suckers that grow out right above the leaf branches. You should try to catch these early, because it is less stressful for the plant to prune them before they get too big. If you are caging the plants, you can leave some of the suckers on to let the plant grow more bushy, but I would still remove most of the lower suckers. Once the plant gets big enough, it is a good idea to remove some of the branches close to the ground and any leaves that are growing too densely to improve airflow and to reduce the risk of diseases. You will also want to prune off any sick looking leaves.','Tomatoes are ripe when they come off of the branch easily if you try to pull on them gently. You can also harvest them earlier than that and use them for green tomatoes or ripen them on the countertop.','Gently pull on the tomatoes to see if they will come off. If you are picking unripe tomatoes, you might want to cut them off at the stem with garden shears or scissors. Avoid pulling on the tomatoes roughly, since this might hurt the plants');
